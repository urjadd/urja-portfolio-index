# Portfolio Index (Build in Public)

A curated list of my Data / AI / LLM projects.  
Status is honest: Planned → Designing → Building → Shipped.

## Projects

| Project | What it does | Stack | Status | Demo | Repo |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Project 1 | <1-liner> | <stack> | Planned | Coming soon | TBD |
| Project 2 | <1-liner> | <stack> | Planned | Coming soon | TBD |
| Project 3 | <1-liner> | <stack> | Planned | Coming soon | TBD |

## Standards I follow for every project repo
Every project includes:
- Demo
- Architecture (`docs/architecture.md`)
- Evaluation (`docs/evaluation.md`)
- Papers / References
- Reproducible setup instructions
